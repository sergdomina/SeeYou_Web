        SEEYOU provides a universal toolbar for video conference providers.
        Meaning you can quickly master most platforms while still benefitting
        from their native functionality. The toolbar includes In-Conference
        Rewind, allowing you to go back and check past comments while still
        following the real-time conference. Fully encrypted sticky notes on
        desktop are hyperlinked to the conference if stored in your free private
        library. An end-to-end encrypted communication suite. Ensuring only the
        sender and intended recipients can read, listen to, and watch the
        content. SEEYOU allows you to record up to 60-seconds Selfie Loop(TM).
        The Selfie Loop substitutes your camera feed when on a call and is handy
        when multitasking.
