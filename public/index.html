    <meta name="description" content="SEEYOU includes the first-ever video conference aggregator integrating all major video conference providers. It is free, with no in-app purchases, will simplify video conferencing, and enable functionalities you never knew you were missing.
    SEEYOU provides a free virtual camera, Selfie Loopâ„¢, which substitutes your camera with a selfie video when making a call or being on a video conference.
    SEEYOU provides a free recording function, so you can record your video conference. You can also make hyperlinked sticky notes and get a free library to store your recordings and notes. You can jump to any part of a recording by clicking on the hyperlinked sticky note.
    SEEYOU also allows you to rewind in real-time while in a video conference, so that you in any time can check what was said earlier.
    You can create video conferences inside SEEYOU for Google Meet, Teams, Webex, and Zoom, and via SEEYOU for many more. You can access all your video conferences in your SEEYOU calendar, where all your meetings fare gathered in one place.
    SEEYOU's chat, video, and voice calls are end-to-end encrypted and genuinely private.">

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
